        DartBot is a 3-DOF cable-driven robot that uses computer vision to accurately throw darts at
        a regulation dart board. It has been created and designed for Columbia University's Mechanical
        Engineering Senior Design project. It will be publicly viewable at the Senior Design Expo in
        Lerner Hall (115th and Broadway, NYC) on May 7, 2015.

        <b>September</b><br>
        DartBot was first incepted in September 2014 as a project for the mechanical engineering department’s
        senior design course at Columbia University. Over the past eight months, it has embarked on a
        long and arduous journey from a concept inside our heads to the final project we have created below.
        While many ideas were thrown out onto the table, the team was attracted to the idea of combining robotics
        with recreational sports in a fun and unique way. We had several ideas ranging from a ping-pong playing
        robot to a basketball shooter, but decided to move forward with a dart-throwing robot for several reasons.
        The implementation of a ping-pong playing robot would have been difficult given our size and budget
        constraints and there had been a basketball-related project a year prior. The team was excited about
        the difficulty of the project as well as its playful nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>October - March</b><br>
        Next, the team was tasked with designing DartBot. Many simpler non-robotic devices or mechanisms
        were suggested to solve the problem of throwing a dart at a dartboard, such as a trebuchet or a
        dart-slinger. However, these ideas didn’t stick for two main reasons. Technically, a trebuchet
        or dart-slinging device would lack significant modularity and dynamicism - not allowing us to achieve
        greater levels of success with the project. Academically, these solutions lacked ingenuity and didn’t
        present themselves as worthwhile research projects. Team DART didn’t want to sacrifice a chance for
        technology development and growth by picking a routine and rather trivial solution to the problem
        of throwing an object at a target. That was not the aim of this endeavor. Thus, the team conducted
        a lot of research into robotic solutions that could solve the difficulties of throwing a dart at a dartboard.
        From this research the team had outlined its major design requirements and began to model the robot’s physical
        design using CAD software. The process of refining DartBot's CAD model and design criteria was
        an iterative one. The team had to satisfy the original design criteria they had established,
        while also adhering and implementing changes based on feedback from faculty and PhD students
        in the department. Ensuring that DartBot would be able to satisfy the design criteria we laid
        out was very difficult and required significant dynamic modeling, CAD modeling, and lots of creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>March - April</b><br>
        Once DartBot’s design was finalized, it was time to begin manufacturing. The team manufactured
        almost every part themselves in-house in Columbia University’s Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate
        Lab (the only exceptions being a few parts ordered online). Assembly and electronics integration happened
        in conjunction with the manufacturing. The first prototype was completed on April 16th. It demonstrated
        DartBot repeatably throwing a steel ball into a small cup four feet away. The team learned a
        great deal about DartBot’s assembly and individual mechanisms from DartBot V.1 and with three weeks
        before the expo, they sought to improve upon DartBot’s few flaws for V.2.

        The final DartBot prototype realizes the full extent of its design in most important ways, and
        is a super fun way to win a game of darts. It uses a 2-DOF cable-driven throwing setup with
        distal and proximal links, and its third degree of freedom rotating base allows it to aim
        freely around a revolution. It uses the Microsoft Kinect to find the position of its target
        dartboard in xyz space, and then commands its motors appropriately to aim and hit the target
        with a dart.
