        DartBot is a 3-DOF cable-driven robot that uses computer vision to accurately throw darts at
        a regulation dart board. It has been created and designed for Columbia University's Mechanical
        Engineering Senior Design project. It will be publicly viewable at the Senior Design Expo in
        Lerner Hall (115th and Broadway, NYC) on May 7, 2015.

    <div class="dartbot-section-body">
      <p>
        DartBot has been in the works since September 2014. It has gone from concept through
        design iterations into the realized prototype seen here. The process has been long, varied, rewarding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Team DartBot waverered between a few distinct projects when generating Senior Design concepts,
        but each one was some variation of a sports-playing robot; we always intended to
        incorporate robotic arm motion <em>and</em> computer vision in tandem, we just weren't
        initially sure what form that would take. Our ideal project was perhaps a ping-pong playing
        robot. However, due to implementational complexity we took some of the ideas from the ping-pong
        player and applied them to the (arguably cooler) project we have today: a deadly accurate
        dart-throwing cable-driven arm-bot.
      </p>
      <p>
        After finalizing our idea we began work in earnest in January. This phase was comprised of
        non-manufacturing sub-projects like : designing DartBot in CREO, budgeting, mechanical analysis,
        and using OpenCV algorithms to find the dartboard with the Kinect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Machining, assembly, and integration came next. These have been the most rewarding phases of
        the DartBot project.

        The final DartBot prototype realizes the full extent of its design in most important ways, and
        is a super fun way to win a game of darts. It uses a 2-DOF cable-driven throwing setup with
        distal and proximal links, and its third degree of freedom rotating base allows it to aim
        freely around a revolution. It uses the Microsoft Kinect to find the position of its target
        dartboard in xyz space, and then commands its motors appropriately to aim and hit the target
        with a dart.
