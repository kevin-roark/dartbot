Template matching in opencv:
http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/imgproc/histograms/template_matching/template_matching.html

Libfreenect / opencv c++ example:

Different matching methods available in OpenCV (all using the matchTemplate function):
  * squared diff
  * normalized squared diff
  * correlation
  * normalized correlation
  * ccooef things

Will be good to experiment with these different methods.
